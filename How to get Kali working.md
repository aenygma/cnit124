# How to get Kali working

This write up is for those like me who when running the virtualbox image of Kali, just get a black screen.

This guide doesn't fix that problem, but allows to access kali via serial console; so no gui, but cli will work.

---

### Add Console output

1. VirtualBox **Settings** â†’ **Serial Port**
2. Check "**Enable Serial Port**"
Port Number: **COM1**
Port Mode: **Host Pipe**
Uncheck "Connect to existing pipe/socket"
Path: **/tmp/kali**

Do this before you start your Kali VM.
This will just add a serial connection to the VM.

On the Host machine, setup minicom and configure it like this

### Setup minicom

1. Install minicom if needed
`sudo apt-get install minicom
sudo minicom -s`
2. Setup Minicom
Serial Port Setup
Serial Device: /tmp/kali
Save setup as dfl
Exit

### Start Serial port on Host

1. `socat unix-connect:/tmp/kali -,raw,echo=0`

(ref: [https://superuser.com/questions/1223865/linux-connect-from-host-to-virtualbox-guest-over-virtual-serial-port](https://superuser.com/questions/1223865/linux-connect-from-host-to-virtualbox-guest-over-virtual-serial-port))

This will setup up your host machine to listen the socket `/tmp/kali` from the VM and display it to screen.
This command will seem to hang when you run it, but it's just waiting for data on the other end of the pipe.

Now, start the VM, then when at the GRUB screen

### Grub edit

1. When at GRUB screen, hit '**e**' 
2. Add the following to the end of "...*nosplash quiet*" line

    `console=ttyS0 console=tty0 ignore_loglevel` to grub config on boot

    (ref; [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Serial_redirect](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Serial_redirect))

You should now start seeing the console output on the `socat` terminal.

Note that this GRUB config change is nor permanent, so when you reboot it wont persist. To do so, do the following

### To make Grub changes permanent

1. Edit ***/etc/default/grub***
`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8"`
2. `sudo update-grub`
